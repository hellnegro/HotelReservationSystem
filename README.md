# HotelReservationSystem
The automation system we created for our CENG201 course

This project is designed to learn the basics of OOP. The purpose of this project is to register the customers to the hotel, while doing this, it checks the availability of the rooms in the hotel and carries out the transactions accordingly. In addition, it also handles the customer's checkout and payment method. One of the additional features is that customers can add special services (such as wake up, breakfast service)

## Setup 

1. First you need to download the Qt interface development tool.
2. If you want to see the data base connections we made, you should also download SQlite studio.
 (If you are not interested in seeing and only interested in the OOP part, Qt is sufficient.)

## Usage

1. First of all, a login page welcomes you in our project. Here we aim to provide a secure login to the system with username and password.
2. Username: test
3. Password: 123
