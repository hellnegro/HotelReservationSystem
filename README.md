# HotelReservationSystem
The automation system we created for our CENG201 course

## Setup 

1. First you need to download the Qt interface development tool.
2. If you want to see the data base connections we made, you should also download SQlite studio.
 (If you are not interested in seeing and only interested in the OOP part, Qt is sufficient.)

## Usage

1. First of all, a login page welcomes you in our project. Here we aim to provide a secure login to the system with username and password.
2. Username: test
3. Password: 123
